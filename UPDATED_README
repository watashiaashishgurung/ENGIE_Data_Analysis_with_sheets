# Energy Data Analysis: Personal Energy Consumption 2023

## Introduction

This case study showcases my ability to interpret data and demonstrate my Excel and Google Sheets skills for data analysis. Have you ever thought about how gas prices fluctuate depending on the quality of the gas and the efficiency of your heating installation? I was curious why my energy bill never perfectly aligned with my forecasted energy costs. Through my analysis, I managed to get money in return!

**PS:** This is also applicable when buying a car or fueling any engine. This quick read will help you save money and energy!

Check out the link below to see how I managed to save energy and money!

## Personal Energy Consumption Data Analysis 2023

Visualizing my energy consumption (gas and electricity) while living in a poorly insulated one-bedroom apartment. I did my best to keep my costs as low as possible. In the link below, you will find my detailed analysis with visualizations.

## Insights and Findings

- **Electricity Consumption:** My electricity usage is fairly consistent, showing a dip during the summer months.
- **Gas Consumption:** Gas consumption peaks during the winter in November. This increase was due to the arrival of my two kittens, Prabel and Promise, who needed warmth. As they grew older, we used the heater less, keeping each other warm during the winter. It made for a very cozy Christmas time.

**Note:** I could not calculate the average energy gain per m³ of gas. Therefore, I am still somewhat dependent on the energy prices set by my provider. Since the central heating installation was not yet fine-tuned to my energy needs, I don't expect additional costs as the predicted intermediate energy bills should cover my consumption smoothly. I aimed to get some money back, but there’s always next year.

## Providers and Distribution

- **ENGIE:** My energy provider for gas and electricity.
- **FLUVIUS:** Responsible for energy distribution within the building, mostly from the consumer to the meter.

ENGIE delivers energy from outside to the building, while FLUVIUS handles meter readings and distribution within the building. I aim to use my energy responsibly to keep my ecological footprint as low as possible.

## Tips to Reduce Your Ecological Footprint

1. **Save Water:** Shower together.
2. **Save Energy:** Eat together. Cooking for multiple people uses almost the same amount of energy as cooking for one, so it's more efficient to eat together or order food. Sometimes, free delivery deals can save time, effort, and energy. Always tip the rider when possible.

Don't worry too much about your energy consumption. Think of it like driving a car—it's important to adjust your driving style to the engine and follow traffic rules. Even if you are a high gas consumer, if your ecological footprint is around the average, you're heading in the right direction. The economy respects these standards, and living in the fast lane of life means your ecological taxes are calculated accordingly.

Improve the accuracy of these calculations by:
- Eating organic products
- Using "green seat" labels when flying
- Attending car-free Sunday events in your local city

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading! Have fun analyzing your energy consumption. Remember, just like driving, it's about adjusting to your situation and finding the best way to be efficient. See you in the next analysis!

**Personal Note:** I recently injured my ankle during football practice and had to put it in plaster. Since then, it's been sensitive, especially when pushing the gas pedal. I feel like roaring through the pain! Anyway, see you on the next one. Cheers!
