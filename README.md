personal energy consumption data analysis 2023
**Visualizing my energy consumption (gas and electricity) living in a poorly isolated one bedroom apartment.**

I did my best to keep my costs as low as possible. In the link below you may find my detailed analysis. With assisting barcharts for visualisation.

My insights and findings:

My electricity consumption is fairly consistent with a half pipe during the summer.
My gas consumption is peak during the winter in November. This is because of the arrival of my two little kittens Prabel and Promise.
I saved them from the winter cold as they were put out of their apartment. They were only 1 month old back then.
Af they get older and stronger. We used the heater less and kept each other warm during the winter. It was a really cosy Christmas time.

!Note that I could not calculate the average Energy gain per mÂ³ gas. Therefore I am still semi dependent on the price they put on my energy bill.
Since this central heating installation was not yet fine tuned to my energy needs.

That said I don't think I won't have to worry about additional costs as the predicted forfaitaire intermediate energy bills will cover up my energy consumption smoothly. I aimed to get some money back but hey there is always next year.
