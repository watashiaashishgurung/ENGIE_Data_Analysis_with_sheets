personal energy consumption data analysis 2023
**Visualizing my energy consumption (gas and electricity) living in a poorly isolated one bedroom apartment.**

I did my best to keep my costs as low as possible. In the link below you may find my detailed analysis. With assisting ] for visualisation.

My insights and findings:

My electricity consumption is fairly consistent with a half pipe during the summer.
My gas consumption is peak during the winter in November. This is because of the arrival of my two little kittens Prabel and Promise.
I saved them from the winter cold as they were put out of their apartment. They were only 1 month old back then.
Af they get older and stronger. We used the heater less and kept each other warm during the winter. It was a really cosy Christmas time.

!Note that I could not calculate the average Energy gain per mÂ³ gas. Therefore I am still semi dependent on the price they put on my energy bill.
Since this central heating installation was not yet fine tuned to my energy needs.

That said I don't think I won't have to worry about additional costs as the predicted forfaitaire intermediate energy bills will cover up my energy consumption smoothly. I aimed to get some money back but hey there is always next year. 


[ENGIE - Fluvius DATA ANALYSIS 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pbG632t34n9r6gKwSt0QY27bi_hKJYLDwMLuGkyM2tU/edit#gid=994224908)

ENGIE is my energy provider gas and electricity.
FLUVIUS is the company that is resposible for the energy distribution within the building, mostly from consumer to the meter.

ENGIE is resposible for delivering the energy from outside to the building. 
FLUVIUS is responsible for the counting of the meters and the destribution within the building.

I am responsible for using my energy responsably. I like to keep my ecological footprint low as possible.

TIPS ON HOW TO KEEP OUR ECO footprint low.

Save water shower together. 

Save energy eat together. 
I know circumstances make the best chef so cooking for yourself or for two or more almost same energy...
so better to eat together or
order food. Sometimes they have great deal on free delivery. That way you can save time, effort and energy.
When ever they have these free delivery deal. I would always tipe the rider though. Thanks for reading!
Have fun analyzing your energy consumption. :]
